"**Water Under the Bridge**" is a song by English singer [Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele "Adele") from her third studio album _[25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25\_(Adele\_album) "25 (Adele album)")_ (2015). Adele wrote the song with its producer, [Greg Kurstin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin "Greg Kurstin"). [Columbia Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records") released the track as the album's fourth single on 14 November 2016. A mid-tempo [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"), [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music "Soul music") and [soft rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_rock "Soft rock") song, "Water Under the Bridge" incorporates influences of [1980s music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_in_music "1980s in music"), [R&B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B "Contemporary R&B"), and a [gospel choir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_choir "Gospel choir") over guitars and [snare drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum "Snare drum"). Inspired by her relationship with charity founder Simon Konecki, whom Adele dated for seven years and married in 2018, the song speaks of forgiveness and details the crucial point in a courtship of determining whether one's partner is willing to put in the work to make it succeed.

[Music critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_critics "Music critics") praised Adele's vocal performance, though some thought it was too loud and criticised some of the production choices. It reached number one in Israel; the top 10 in Poland, Belgium, and Iceland; and gained Platinum or higher [certifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification "Music recording certification") in Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Adele performed it for her [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") special _[Adele Live in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele\_Live\_in\_New\_York\_City "Adele Live in New York City")_ and on _[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tonight\_Show\_Starring\_Jimmy\_Fallon "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon")_ and included it on the [set list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_list "Set list") of her concert tour [Adele Live 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Live_2016 "Adele Live 2016") and her [residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_residency "Concert residency")[Weekends with Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekends_with_Adele "Weekends with Adele"). In 2021, a [mashup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(video) "Mashup (video)") of it and [Megan Thee Stallion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion "Megan Thee Stallion")'s performance of "[Body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_(Megan_Thee_Stallion_song) "Body (Megan Thee Stallion song)")" at the [American Music Awards of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Music_Awards_of_2020 "American Music Awards of 2020") became a trend on [TikTok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok "TikTok").

[Greg Kurstin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin "Greg Kurstin") (_pictured in 2017_) produced and co-wrote "Water Under the Bridge".

[Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele "Adele") announced in February 2013 that she was holding meetings related to her third studio album.[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-1) Initial recording sessions for the album were unfruitful, she recounted: "I felt like I was never going to finish this record. It was a long process. I wanted to give up a lot because I couldn't do it. I thought I'd run out of ideas and I'd lost my ability to write a song."[[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-2) Adele made progress upon meeting with American producer [Greg Kurstin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin "Greg Kurstin"), with whom she was able to work constructively and "it all poured right out of [her]".[[3]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-3) They wrote the song "[Hello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Adele_song) "Hello (Adele song)")" (2015),[[4]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-4) which was released as the [lead single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single "Lead single") from the album and reached number one in 36 countries, and its [music video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video "Music video") broke the [Vevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vevo "Vevo") record for most single-day views.[[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-5)[[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-6)

Kurstin produced two more songs for _[25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25\_(Adele\_album) "25 (Adele album)")_ (2015)—"[Million Years Ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Years_Ago_(song) "Million Years Ago (song)")" and "Water Under the Bridge".[[7]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Liner-7) The latter was inspired by Adele's relationship with charity founder Simon Konecki, whom she dated for seven years and married in May 2018, a topic she is usually reluctant to discuss in her music.[[8]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-8)[[9]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-9) She stated: "'Water Under the Bridge' is more like, I'm waiting for him to be horrible but I don't think he's gonna be, waiting for the relationship to end."[[10]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-10) Adele thought that although her past relationships faltered and burned out at the slightest glimpse of an obstacle, her bond with Konecki made her feel "superpowerful" and was enduring: "Overcoming everything is actually what makes us so great and so powerful, and makes our love so deep."[[11]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-11)

Adele announced _25_'s tracklist, which included "Water Under the Bridge" as the sixth track, on 22 October 2015.[[12]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-12) The song became available for [digital download](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download "Music download") on the album, which was released on 20 November 2015.[[13]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Apple_Music-13)[XL Recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XL_Recordings "XL Recordings") released it as the fourth single from _25_ on the [iTunes Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store "ITunes Store") with single artwork.[[14]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-iTunes_GB-14)[[15]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-KellyCover-15)[Columbia Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records") serviced "Water Under the Bridge" to [adult album alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_album_alternative "Adult album alternative") and [contemporary hit radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio "Contemporary hit radio") stations in the United States on 14 and 15 November 2016, respectively.[[16]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-AAA-16)[[17]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-CHR-17)

Kurstin played bass, drums, guitar, piano, and keyboards. [Tom Coyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coyne_(music_engineer) "Tom Coyne (music engineer)") and [Randy Merrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Merrill "Randy Merrill")[mastered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio) "Mastering (audio)") it at [Sterling Sound Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Jensen#Studio "Ted Jensen") in New York City, and [Serban Ghenea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serban_Ghenea "Serban Ghenea") and John Hanes handled [mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music) "Audio mixing (recorded music)") at MixStar Studios in [Virginia Beach, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Beach,_Virginia "Virginia Beach, Virginia").[[7]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Liner-7)

"Water Under the Bridge" is a mid-tempo [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"), [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music "Soul music"), and [soft rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_rock "Soft rock") song,[[15]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-KellyCover-15)[[18]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-digitalspy-18)[[19]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-harpersbazaar-19)[[20]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-RS_Adele-20) with influences of [1980s music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_in_music "1980s in music") and [R&B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B "Contemporary R&B").[[21]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-21)[[22]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-22) The song has an instrumentation of guitars and [reverberating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation "Reverberation")[snare drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum "Snare drum").[[23]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-chicagotribune-23)[[24]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Independent-24) It opens with an [electro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_(music) "Electro (music)")-drum beat and a [tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_music "Tropical music"), [trip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_hop "Trip hop") riff, followed by a [jazz hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands "Jazz hands")[melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody "Melody"). After a series of key changes, the [gospel choir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_choir "Gospel choir") in the background "finally gets going" towards the climax of "Water Under the Bridge" according to _[PopMatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PopMatters "PopMatters")_'s Chris Gerard,[[25]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-gigwise-25)[[26]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Popmatters-26) which _[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling\_Stone "Rolling Stone")_'s Jon Dolan described as "gospel-steeped ecstasy".[[27]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-27) Sal Cinquemani of _[Slant Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant\_Magazine "Slant Magazine")_ called some of the song's vocals "submerged yelps", and Gerard alleged that they were "digitally treated".[[26]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Popmatters-26)[[28]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Slant-28)

"Water Under the Bridge" has a lyrical theme of forgiveness.[[29]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Exclaim!-29) The song details uncertainty and the crucial point in a relationship of determining whether one's "partner is in or out". Adele attempts to protract a cantankerous romantic relationship on it, promising she wants to stay together but feeling driven apart by his recklessness.[[30]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-30)[[31]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-31) She asks if he is "going to let [her] down", he should "let [her] down gently".[[18]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-digitalspy-18) In an alternate take, _[Vogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue\_(magazine) "Vogue (magazine)")_'s Patricia Garcia interpreted "Water Under the Bridge" as a song about "a mismatched relationship that she clearly knows she needs to end".[[32]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-32) Leonie Cooper of _[NME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME "NME")_ described the song as a "dramatic diary entry to her ex".[[33]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-33)

Critical reception
------------------

_[Digital Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_Spy "Digital Spy")_'s Lewis Corner thought the song possessed the "chewiest melody" Adele had ever recorded to, and though its production recalled Kurstin's work on [Katy Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry "Katy Perry")'s album _[Prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism\_(Katy\_Perry\_album) "Prism (Katy Perry album)")_ (2013), Adele distinguished it due to the piercing lyrics and her vocals.[[18]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-digitalspy-18) Andy Gill of _[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Independent "The Independent")_ believed that its understated style allowed Adele's vocals to shine.[[24]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Independent-24) Cinquemani likened "Water Under the Bridge" to the work of [Jessie Ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Ware "Jessie Ware") and found its abstruse but intrepid flourishes among the few moments on _25_ that did justice to Adele's strong and dynamic voice.[[28]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Slant-28) Writing for _[DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY\_(magazine) "DIY (magazine)")_, Tom Connick said the clangorous drumming and capering guitar lines elevated the song, and _[The Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Daily\_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")_'s [Neil McCormick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_McCormick "Neil McCormick") described it as a mysterious and booming "big production drama".[[34]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-34)[[35]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-35)_[Clash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash\_(magazine) "Clash (magazine)")_'s Gareth James felt that, though it had a behemoth chorus, it perfectly balances between being monumental and innocuous.[[36]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-36)[Stephen Thomas Erlewine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine "Stephen Thomas Erlewine") of [AllMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMusic "AllMusic") described "Water Under the Bridge" as "begging to be played over the closing credits of an inspirational biopic".[[37]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-37) Writing for _[Exclaim!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclaim! "Exclaim!")_, Sarah Murphy was pleased by Adele taking a break from the "piano-pop formula" to explore "more interesting, groove-driven patterns" on the song.[[29]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Exclaim!-29)_[The Boston Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Boston\_Globe "The Boston Globe")_'s Sarah Rodman described it as an "[earwormy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm "Earworm"), hip-swiveler" that added the necessary "bounce" to _25_.[[38]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-38)

_[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_ wrote that Adele depicts the gravest of pain with a great deal of lucidity and composure on "Water Under the Bridge", and it could be placid if Adele's vocals were less loud.[[39]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-39) Gerard deemed the song among _25_'s "least successful tracks", owing to its beats and Adele's extremely loud vocals. He thought its melody resembled pop radio hits of the time but found its concluding "[wall of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_sound "Wall of sound")" and choir a "stirring conclusion".[[26]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-Popmatters-26) The _[Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago\_Tribune "Chicago Tribune")_'s Greg Kot found the gospel choir a sketchy addition on "Water Under the Bridge" and its snare drums annoying and reminiscent of a cannon being fired.[[23]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-chicagotribune-23) Alexandra Pollard of _[Gigwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigwise "Gigwise")_ found the song's beat fascinating but opined a minimalistic production might have fit it as well.[[25]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-gigwise-25) Writing for the _[Toronto Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\_Star "Toronto Star")_, Ben Rayner believed that eschewing the "windblown, [Sermon From the Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount "Sermon on the Mount") production" would not have hurt its quality.[[40]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-40)_[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_'s Will Hodgkinson, and the _[Business Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_Post "Business Post")_'s Johnnie Craig and Tony Clayton-Lea, criticised its 1980s influences, the latter pair describing it as "a forgotten 1980s dad-funk B-side".[[41]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-41)[[42]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-42)

The song appeared on retrospective rankings of Adele's discography in the 2020s. _Rolling Stone_ listed "Water Under the Bridge" as Adele's 18th-best song, Brittany Spanos expressing disappointment that "this slice of pop heaven" did not become a huge success.[[43]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-43)_[Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard\_(magazine) "Billboard (magazine)")_'s Chuck Arnold placed the song at number 28 in a ranking of her discography and noted that though it is "a perfectly good pop song" and "Adele elevates whatever she touches", it could have been recorded by any of her peers.[[44]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-44)[Alexis Petridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Petridis "Alexis Petridis") of _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_, who ranked it at number 34, offered a similar take: "'Water Under the Bridge' lays bare the drawbacks of working with blue-chip songwriters, [...] It's a perfectly serviceable bit of pop-soul, with a good chorus and a vague hint of [tropical house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_house "Tropical house"), but it feels slightly boilerplate."[[45]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Under_the_Bridge#cite_note-45)
