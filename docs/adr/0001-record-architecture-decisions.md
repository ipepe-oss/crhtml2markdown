# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-06-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made for the `crhtml2markdown` project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/),
to document important choices. ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr` and numbered
sequentially.

## Consequences

Future contributors should add new ADR files when making significant design
decisions. This repository is initially focused on creating a Crystal library
and binary for converting HTML to Markdown, so further ADRs will explore the
implementation choices.
