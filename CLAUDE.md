This is a crystal project. While working on it make sure to:
- Run `crystal tool format` to format the code.
- Write specs for any new functionality in the `spec/` folder.
- Run `shards build` to compile the project.
- Use `crystal spec` to run the tests and ensure everything is working correctly.
- Check test coverage with `crystal scripts/check-tests-coverage.cr` to ensure all source files have corresponding specs.
